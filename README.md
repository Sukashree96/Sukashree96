# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sukashree Suresh Kumar
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a brief overview of who I am and what I do.

## About Me

I am a passionate data scientist and machine learning enthusiast with a strong background in Biotechnology and Health Industry. I thrive on solving complex problems and deriving meaningful insights from data to drive actionable decisions.

## What I'm Interested In

I'm deeply interested in exploring the intersection of data science and machine learning, particularly in the context of [specific industry or domain]. My areas of interest include:

- Data Preparation
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Model Interpretability and Explainability
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

## What I'm Currently Learning

I'm continuously expanding my skill set and knowledge base. Currently, I'm focusing on mastering the following:

- Advanced machine learning techniques
- Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Model deployment and productionization
- Big data technologies and distributed computing

## Projects I'm Working On

I'm actively working on a variety of machine learning projects that showcase my skills in data preparation, preprocessing, analysis, and modeling. Some of my recent projects include:

1. [Optimisation of Amino Acid Selection for the Prediction of Claudin Types Using Machine Learning.](Link to Project 1): The classification of Claudins is necessary to understand better their functions and roles in different tissues and physiological processes. We can gather insights into their specific functions, interactions, and contributions to tight junctions by organizing them into different groups, such as anion, cation, and barrier. The dataset used in this study consists of Claudin proteins belonging to these different classes, whose sequences are available in a public database. Through multiple sequence alignments of all the Claudins, the dataset is combined with amino acid properties to predict their respective classes. The study also identifies the critical amino acid positions and their properties with feature importance scores that contribute the most to the prediction, and these findings are compared with existing theoretical data. A Random Forests model is developed to accurately predict the Claudin classes by integrating multiple sequence alignments with amino acid properties. The model achieves high training accuracies of 96.74
